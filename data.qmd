1.  Has anyone discussed with their healthcare provider their personal cancer risk factors, and are they actively engaged in any preventive measures to reduce their risk based on the current cancer incidence and mortality rates in their region? Some may even not be aware of it. So, this question encourages individuals to reflect on their awareness of cancer risk factors and their proactive efforts in adopting preventive measures. It also opens the door for discussions about the importance of regular screenings, lifestyle choices, and other factors that can contribute to cancer prevention.Largely, this question falls in the category of Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates, where we can Visualize the geographical distribution of cancer incidence and mortality rates across different states or regions in the USA and then we can provide use choropleth maps to show variations in cancer rates, helping to identify high-risk areas and guide targeted prevention efforts.2. We can ask the audience to think - Considering the diversity in the prevalence of different cancer types among various demographic groups, have you ever reflected on how your own demographics, such as age, gender, or ethnicity, might influence your awareness of specific cancer risks, and does this influence your approach to health and preventive measures?I asked this question because it encourages people to consider their own demographic factors in the context of cancer awareness and prevention. It basically opens up a conversation about personal health choices and the role that demographic considerations might play in shaping one's understanding of cancer risks and the importance of preventive measures.Largely, this question falls in the category of Cancer Types and Demographics, where we can explore the prevalence of different cancer types and their distribution across demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity) and then we can create stacked bar charts or heatmaps to represent the incidence of various cancer types within different demographic groups, highlighting disparities and trends.3. Another question to ask the audience is - As you reflect on your own experiences and awareness, have you noticed any changes in how cancer is discussed or perceived over the years? How do you think these temporal trends in cancer rates might influence your attitudes towards regular screenings and health-conscious choices in your day-to-day life?Its very important to ask this question because it encourages people to consider their personal observations and experiences regarding the discourse around cancer over time. It prompts reflection on whether changing trends in cancer rates influence their perceptions and behaviors related to preventive healthcare practices.Largely, it falls in the category of Temporal Trends in Cancer Rates where we can analyze how cancer incidence and mortality rates have changed over time and develop time-series visualizations such as line charts or area charts to illustrate temporal trends, helping to identify patterns and the effectiveness of interventions.4. We can also ask them that - Have you ever reflected on your own approach to cancer screenings in the varying rates of detection methods? How do you stay informed about recommended screenings, and what steps do you take to ensure you are proactive about your health?Largely, this falls in the category of Cancer Screening and Detection Rates where we can visualize the rates of cancer screening and early detection methods and use bar charts or pie charts to depict the percentage of the population undergoing regular screenings for common cancers, highlighting areas where screening programs may need improvement.5. How about this question - Reflecting on your own health journey, how would you say your awareness of cancer survival rates and treatment outcomes has influenced your attitude towards seeking medical care and making informed decisions about your health? Are there specific experiences that have shaped your perspective on the importance of early detection and treatment effectiveness?Basically, these types of questions will invite people to consider how this awareness has impacted their approach to healthcare decisions and the significance they place on factors such as early detection and treatment effectiveness.Largely, this falls in the category of Survival Rates and Treatment Outcomes where we can assess the survival rates of cancer patients and outcomes based on different treatment approaches and (IDK) create Kaplan-Meier survival curves (not sure) or other visualizations to show the probability of survival over time, stratified by treatment methods and cancer types.6. In your own health journey or the experiences of those close to you, have you ever noticed or encountered disparities in cancer outcomes among different demographic groups? How do you think awareness of these disparities can influence our collective efforts to ensure equitable access to healthcare?Largely, this falls in the category of Cancer Health Disparities, where we can visualize disparities in cancer outcomes among different socioeconomic groups and maybe use socioeconomic indicators to create visualizations that highlight disparities in cancer incidence, survival rates, and access to treatment. (Have to decide)7. Other than these major questions, I was thinking of cases where we can dig deeper and visualize genetic mutations and variations associated with different cancer types (One solution can be to utilize genomic data visualizations such as mutation landscapes, Circos plots, or heatmaps to represent genomic alterations in different cancer types) or explore the accessibility and distribution of cancer care facilities (Create maps or scatter plots to visualize the geographical distribution of cancer care facilities and identify areas with limited access to specialized cancer care) or Risk Factors and Behavioral Patterns (like visualize the impact of lifestyle and behavioral factors on cancer incidence and use pie charts or bar charts to represent the proportion of cancer cases attributed to various risk factors, such as smoking, diet, and physical activity.)
