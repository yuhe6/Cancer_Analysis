    "text": "1.1 Why did we think of this problem statement and in particular about “Cancer”?\nFor us, a dataset is not just a collection of statistics, it is a tapestry woven with the stories of real individuals, families, and communities. We believe in the power of visualization to breathe life into these seemingly abstract numbers, revealing patterns and nuances that might otherwise remain concealed.\nWhy is it personal for us? Because every data point represents a person—a mother, a brother, a friend—whose life has been touched by cancer. Visualization, in our eyes, is not merely a tool for making sense of information; it is a vehicle for understanding the profoundly human stories that lie behind the data. It’s about acknowledging that these numbers are not just clinical entries but narratives of resilience, struggle, and hope.\nVisualizations serve as a bridge between the scientific and the personal realms. They go beyond graphs and charts to provide a window into the lived experiences of individuals and communities affected by cancer. Through visualizations, we can comprehend the impact of this pervasive disease on diverse populations, guiding healthcare decisions, inspiring policy changes, and influencing individual choices.\nEach trend unveiled in a visualization holds the potential to make a significant difference. It could be the difference between early detection and missed opportunities for intervention, between effective healthcare strategies and overlooked disparities. The patterns we uncover may lead to targeted interventions in high-risk areas or underscore the importance of specific preventive measures.\nThe power of visualization lies in its ability to empower individuals. Beyond being a tool for professionals, it becomes a source of knowledge and agency for people facing the uncertainties of cancer. By translating complex data into accessible visual narratives, we aim to empower individuals to take charge of their health. It’s about providing a roadmap for understanding risks, making informed decisions, and adopting proactive preventive measures.\nIn a deeply personal sense, visualizing cancer data is not just a technical task; it is a mission to translate numbers into narratives that resonate with the human experience. It is about standing in solidarity with those affected by cancer, recognizing the challenges they face, and working towards a world where fewer stories are marked by the trials imposed by this formidable disease. Through visualization, we strive to contribute to a collective effort to improve awareness, facilitate understanding, and ultimately make strides toward a future where cancer is less daunting and more conquerable."

    "text": "1.2 Why cancer?\nIt’s a question that reverberates through the corridors of research labs, the offices of healthcare professionals, and the minds of individuals facing the daunting reality of a diagnosis. It’s a question that leads us into the intricate web of cancer datasets, a realm where numbers hold the tales of courage, resilience, and the persistent quest for understanding.\nWithin the sprawling landscape of cancer datasets lies a treasure trove of information—a mosaic of demographic details, genetic intricacies, and the delicate threads that weave through treatment outcomes. It’s a labyrinth of complexities, each data point representing a unique journey, a unique story. Yet, in this complexity, there’s a call to unravel, to make sense of the seemingly chaotic dance of numbers.\nVisualizations step forward as our storytellers. They become the brushstrokes that paint a clearer picture, a narrative that transcends the barriers of complexity. In the hands of skilled data visualizers, the intricate details of cancer datasets transform into a tapestry of understanding, where patterns and trends come to life.\nConsider a scene where a researcher, armed with charts and graphs, presents their findings to a room filled with healthcare professionals. The intricate dance of lines and colors on the screen becomes a visual symphony, conveying the nuances of cancer demographics. It simplifies the communication of complex information, allowing the audience to grasp the essence of the narrative without getting lost in the intricacies of the dataset.\nIn a policymaker’s office, a series of maps unfold on a table, each contour representing the geospatial distribution of cancer incidence rates. The visual narrative guides decisions about resource allocation and intervention strategies, offering a compass for navigating the vast landscape of public health.\nThe power of visualization extends beyond the confines of conference rooms and research labs. In a cozy living room, a family gathers around a screen displaying an animated chart illustrating the impact of lifestyle choices on cancer risks. The visualization becomes a conversation starter, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health.\nThe answer to “Why cancer?” becomes woven into the visual narratives that unfold before us. It’s a quest for understanding, for compassion, and for progress. Visualizations transform the abstract into the tangible, the overwhelming into the manageable. They bridge the gap between the technicalities of cancer datasets and the human experiences they encapsulate.\nAnd so, in the quiet hum of a bustling hospital, the question lingers, but now with a sense of purpose. Why cancer? To uncover stories, to inspire understanding, and to chart a course towards a future where the complexities of this formidable adversary are met with knowledge, empathy, and the transformative power of visualization."

    "text": "3 Research Plan:\nOur approach involves delving more profoundly into the intricacies of the problem statement by posing pertinent questions tailored to the perspective of our target audience. This strategic inquiry aims to provide us with enhanced clarity and a well-directed framework for our research endeavors. In our context, the target audience encompasses a broad spectrum, including healthy individuals, those with disabilities, and individuals dealing with health issues. Importantly, this audience may vary in their awareness levels regarding cancer and its potential consequences. By engaging with this diverse audience, we seek to gain comprehensive insights that will inform and shape the trajectory of our research.\nThis question encourages individuals to reflect on their awareness of cancer risk factors and their proactive efforts in adopting preventive measures. It also opens the door for discussions about the importance of regular screenings, lifestyle choices, and other factors that can contribute to cancer prevention.Largely, this question falls in the category of Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates, where we can Visualize the geographical distribution of cancer incidence and mortality rates across different states or regions in the USA and then we can provide use choropleth maps to show variations in cancer rates, helping to identify high-risk areas and guide targeted prevention efforts.\nIt basically opens up a conversation about personal health choices and the role that demographic considerations might play in shaping one’s understanding of cancer risks and the importance of preventive measures.Largely, this question falls in the category of Cancer Types and Demographics, where we can explore the prevalence of different cancer types and their distribution across demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity) and then we can create stacked bar charts or heatmaps to represent the incidence of various cancer types within different demographic groups, highlighting disparities and trends.\nIts very important to ask this question because it encourages people to consider their personal observations and experiences regarding the discourse around cancer over time. It prompts reflection on whether changing trends in cancer rates influence their perceptions and behaviors related to preventive healthcare practices.Largely, it falls in the category of Temporal Trends in Cancer Rates where we can analyze how cancer incidence and mortality rates have changed over time and develop time-series visualizations such as line charts or area charts to illustrate temporal trends, helping to identify patterns and the effectiveness of interventions.\nLargely, this falls in the category of Cancer Screening and Detection Rates where we can visualize the rates of cancer screening and early detection methods and use bar charts or pie charts to depict the percentage of the population undergoing regular screenings for common cancers, highlighting areas where screening programs may need improvement.\nBasically, these types of questions will invite people to consider how this awareness has impacted their approach to healthcare decisions and the significance they place on factors such as early detection and treatment effectiveness.\nLargely, this falls in the category of Survival Rates and Treatment Outcomes where we can assess the survival rates of cancer patients and outcomes based on different treatment approaches and (IDK) create Kaplan-Meier survival curves (not sure) or other visualizations to show the probability of survival over time, stratified by treatment methods and cancer types.\nLargely, this falls in the category of Cancer Health Disparities, where we visualize disparities in cancer outcomes among different socioeconomic groups and maybe use socioeconomic indicators to create visualizations that highlight disparities in cancer incidence, survival rates, and access to treatment."

    "section": "2.4 Missing value analysis:",
    "text": "2.4 Missing value analysis:\n\nSuppresed dataset:\n\n\n\nData are suppressed if the figures represent fewer than 16 cases for the specific category in the output. This is not neccesary in our use case as more data leads to more crisp vizulization and ideally, we also want to find the common trends and factors which leads to fewer cases. But the dataset provider has their own conditions.\nCounts and rates are suppressed for cells at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level for the race categories “American Indian or Alaska Native” or “Asian or Pacific Islander” when the specific category’s population for rate calculations is less than 50,000 persons.\nData are suppressed at the state and MSA level for certain race and ethnicity groups: American Indian or Alaska Native data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, and New York;\nHispanic Asian or Pacific Islander and Hispanic Black or African American data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of Kansas;\nRace by ethnicity data are suppressed for state specific statistics for residents of North Dakota and Wisconsin.\nEthnicity data are also suppressed for residents of North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nAdditonally, states decide whether to suppress data for specific race and ethnicity categories.\nOvercoming the challenge of suppression is paramount in our visualization task, as the potential loss of information can result in deceptive graphics and misguided insights. The granularity of the dataset holds crucial significance for our use case, where we aim to discern common norms or trends spanning from 1999 to 2020. Any predetermined threshold set by the data provider may restrict our access to features, particularly in addressing demographical questions. The inclusion of bias underscores the need to confront and account for biases in our analysis.\n\nThe presence of “Unknown or Missing” values in column indicators poses a substantial hindrance to our research. Such occurrences can misdirect the research, introduce bias, and potentially yield incomplete or skewed conclusions. The prevalence of these values is widespread across various query criteria, amplifying the challenge.\nHighlighting ‘0’ values introduces a significant concern for our use case. In our real-world context, a complete absence of a particular cancer type within a group of people, regions, or states contradicts common patterns. This anomaly threatens to introduce bias and instability in our visualizations, potentially leading to erroneous analyses or conclusions. Addressing this issue is pivotal for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our findings."
