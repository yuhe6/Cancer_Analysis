    "text": "1.1 Why did we think of this problem statement and in particular about “Cancer”?\nFor us, a dataset is not just a collection of statistics, it is a tapestry woven with the stories of real individuals, families, and communities. We believe in the power of visualization to breathe life into these seemingly abstract numbers, revealing patterns and nuances that might otherwise remain concealed.\nWhy is it personal for us? Because every data point represents a person—a mother, a brother, a friend—whose life has been touched by cancer. Visualization, in our eyes, is not merely a tool for making sense of information; it is a vehicle for understanding the profoundly human stories that lie behind the data. It’s about acknowledging that these numbers are not just clinical entries but narratives of resilience, struggle, and hope.\nVisualizations serve as a bridge between the scientific and the personal realms. They go beyond graphs and charts to provide a window into the lived experiences of individuals and communities affected by cancer. Through visualizations, we can comprehend the impact of this pervasive disease on diverse populations, guiding healthcare decisions, inspiring policy changes, and influencing individual choices.\nEach trend unveiled in a visualization holds the potential to make a significant difference. It could be the difference between early detection and missed opportunities for intervention, between effective healthcare strategies and overlooked disparities. The patterns we uncover may lead to targeted interventions in high-risk areas or underscore the importance of specific preventive measures.\nThe power of visualization lies in its ability to empower individuals. Beyond being a tool for professionals, it becomes a source of knowledge and agency for people facing the uncertainties of cancer. By translating complex data into accessible visual narratives, we aim to empower individuals to take charge of their health. It’s about providing a roadmap for understanding risks, making informed decisions, and adopting proactive preventive measures.\nIn a deeply personal sense, visualizing cancer data is not just a technical task; it is a mission to translate numbers into narratives that resonate with the human experience. It is about standing in solidarity with those affected by cancer, recognizing the challenges they face, and working towards a world where fewer stories are marked by the trials imposed by this formidable disease. Through visualization, we strive to contribute to a collective effort to improve awareness, facilitate understanding, and ultimately make strides toward a future where cancer is less daunting and more conquerable."

    "text": "1.2 Why cancer?\nIt’s a question that reverberates through the corridors of research labs, the offices of healthcare professionals, and the minds of individuals facing the daunting reality of a diagnosis. It’s a question that leads us into the intricate web of cancer datasets, a realm where numbers hold the tales of courage, resilience, and the persistent quest for understanding.\nWithin the sprawling landscape of cancer datasets lies a treasure trove of information—a mosaic of demographic details, genetic intricacies, and the delicate threads that weave through treatment outcomes. It’s a labyrinth of complexities, each data point representing a unique journey, a unique story. Yet, in this complexity, there’s a call to unravel, to make sense of the seemingly chaotic dance of numbers.\nVisualizations step forward as our storytellers. They become the brushstrokes that paint a clearer picture, a narrative that transcends the barriers of complexity. In the hands of skilled data visualizers, the intricate details of cancer datasets transform into a tapestry of understanding, where patterns and trends come to life.\nConsider a scene where a researcher, armed with charts and graphs, presents their findings to a room filled with healthcare professionals. The intricate dance of lines and colors on the screen becomes a visual symphony, conveying the nuances of cancer demographics. It simplifies the communication of complex information, allowing the audience to grasp the essence of the narrative without getting lost in the intricacies of the dataset.\nIn a policymaker’s office, a series of maps unfold on a table, each contour representing the geospatial distribution of cancer incidence rates. The visual narrative guides decisions about resource allocation and intervention strategies, offering a compass for navigating the vast landscape of public health.\nThe power of visualization extends beyond the confines of conference rooms and research labs. In a cozy living room, a family gathers around a screen displaying an animated chart illustrating the impact of lifestyle choices on cancer risks. The visualization becomes a conversation starter, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health.\nThe answer to “Why cancer?” becomes woven into the visual narratives that unfold before us. It’s a quest for understanding, for compassion, and for progress. Visualizations transform the abstract into the tangible, the overwhelming into the manageable. They bridge the gap between the technicalities of cancer datasets and the human experiences they encapsulate.\nAnd so, in the quiet hum of a bustling hospital, the question lingers, but now with a sense of purpose. Why cancer? To uncover stories, to inspire understanding, and to chart a course towards a future where the complexities of this formidable adversary are met with knowledge, empathy, and the transformative power of visualization."

    "text": "2.1 1. D1: Cancer Incidence (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer-v2020.HTML):\nWhat is the datasource all about?\n\nCancer incidence data are available for the United States, state and metropolitan areas (MSA) by age group, race, sex, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, childhood cancer classifications and cancer site for the years 1999 - 2020. Cancer incidence data are available for Puerto Rico by age group, sex, year of diagnosis, childhood cancer classifications and cancer site for the years 2005 - 2020. \n\nSource of the dataset?\nAll data are provided by CDC offices , healthcare practitioner and other agencies.\nThe United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) are the official federal statistics on cancer incidence from registries having high-quality data and cancer mortality statistics for 50 states and the District of Columbia. USCS are produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). For a list of all USCS contributors and partners, visit USCS Contributors.\nData are provided by: \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)\nThe National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program\n\nData for years 1999-2020 are provided as reported to NPCR and SEER in the 2022 data submission, released 2023.\nData collection?\n\nThere are two ways to collect the data :\na. Downloading (export) -&gt; We can download the datasets in multiple formats ex. .txt or .xml\nb. CDC WONDER API: Only national data are available for query by the API. The data response page includes more information about the possible request parameters for the specific online database. The response file contains information that supports both drawing the results table and also re-populating the request form for WONDER, including labels, validations and “caveat” messages that may be displayed to the end-user. Thus the response file may give you a broader sense of the metadata that supports possible variable/value pairs in forming a potential data request. Currently, this XML response file doesn’t have charts or maps. WONDER uses the data in this response file to generate the input to the charting and mapping functions, after the user clicks on the chart or map tabs. Send a POST request to the WONDER.cdc.gov web server. The first parameter is the contents of an XML document specifying the request criteria. Consent to abide by the data use restrictions is required, and can be included in the string that is passed as the 1st parameter, or can be passed as optional second parameter. The result of the request will be returned as an XML document. The results include the data table and applicable caveats and footnotes. All data use restrictions are enforced and apply to these data.\n\nThe XML document that specifies the request has a specific format and valid parameters specific to each unique online database.\nFormat of the data and dimensions of the data:\n\nExporting the dataset: .txt is expected to get downloaded. The data present in the the file is unstructured comma seperated which contains the entire web page history content. Parsing the unstructured data (.txt) will be experimented as a part of data ingestion/processing.\nWONDER API: .xml is expected to get fetched (by REQUEST API method). The XML file is structured and can be easily be converted into a csv file for further usage. This will be experimented with the data ingestion/processing pipeline.\n\nComments on the dimensions of the data:\n\nThe dimensions of the dataset is variable as it depends on the query criteria which we form. Ex. Query Criteria: Group By: Cancer Sites Show Totals: Disabled Show Zero Values: False Show Suppressed: False Calculate Rates Per: 100,000 Standard Population: 2000 U.S. Std. Million\n\nDimentions: Columns :- (Cancer Sites, Count)\nand for query criteria: Group By: Cancer Sites; Region Show Totals: Disabled Show Zero Values: True Show Suppressed: True Calculate Rates Per: 100,000 Standard Population: 2000 U.S. Std. Million\nDimentions: Columns :- (Cancer Sites, Region, Count, Population, Age-Adjusted Rate Per 100,000, Crude Rate Per 100,000)\nFrequently updated? The CDC WONDER database is frequently updated time to time (~~~ 3 months) but the dataset which we are referring - United States and Puerto Rico Cancer Statistics, 1999-2020 Incidence Results is limited to the year range of 1999 to 2020, of which the dataset is collected.\nImporting dataset:\nWe will be using API calls to fetch the real time dataset by providing QUERY CRITERIA as REQUEST to the server and recieving xml file in return which futher have to be processed in data ingestion pipeline.\nhttps://wonder.cdc.gov/cancermort-v2020.HTML https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancermir-v2020.HTML\nCancer types and demographics:\nIdeally, our use case is follows are criterion to move ahead and visulize the cancer types vs. demographics. WONDER CDC filtered right way will provide us a grouped dataset. We have targetted to work on the following cases:\n\nCancer Types Grouped by Race and Ethnicity,\nCancer Types Grouped by Region and State\nCancer Types Grouped by Age, Race, and Ethnicity\nChildhood Cancer by Site Groups\nChildhood Cancer by Age (&lt;1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19)\nCancer Types Grouped by County\nThe dimensions of the dataset is variable as it depends on the query criteria which we form. Ex. Query Criteria: Group By: Cancer Sites; Region; State Show Totals: Disabled Show Zero Values: True Show Suppressed: True Calculate Rates Per: 100,000 Standard Population: 2000 U.S. Std. Million\n\nDimentions: Columns :- (Cancer Sites, Race, Ethnicity, Count)\nand for query criteria: Group By: Cancer Sites; Region Show Totals: Disabled Show Zero Values: True Show Suppressed: True Calculate Rates Per: 100,000 Standard Population: 2000 U.S. Std.

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis:\n\nSuppresed dataset:\n\n\n\nData are suppressed if the figures represent fewer than 16 cases for the specific category in the output. This is not neccesary in our use case as more data leads to more crisp vizulization and ideally, we also want to find the common trends and factors which leads to fewer cases. But the dataset provider has their own conditions.\nCounts and rates are suppressed for cells at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level for the race categories “American Indian or Alaska Native” or “Asian or Pacific Islander” when the specific category’s population for rate calculations is less than 50,000 persons.\nData are suppressed at the state and MSA level for certain race and ethnicity groups: American Indian or Alaska Native data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, and New York;\nHispanic Asian or Pacific Islander and Hispanic Black or African American data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of Kansas;\nRace by ethnicity data are suppressed for state specific statistics for residents of North Dakota and Wisconsin.\nEthnicity data are also suppressed for residents of North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nAdditonally, states decide whether to suppress data for specific race and ethnicity categories.\nThe suppression is a major challenge for our vizualization task as a potential information loss leads to misleading graphics and insights. Further, granularity of the dataset matters for use case as we are trying to vision any common norms or trends in the dataset from 1999 to 2020. Even if a threshold is being decided by the data provider, it will lead us to smaller dataset with limited feature access, as we will be dealing largely with demographical questions. #bias - to be included\nThis request produces 193,036 rows, but 75,000 is the maximum allowed. Simplify this request, or send a series of smaller ones. For example, group results by race but limit each query to a single race. Send a request for each race group and then merge the results. Please contact user support for further assistance.\n\nIndication of “Unknown or Missing” values in the column This typically creates an obstacle in our research as ideally it will lead the research in the wrong direction, create bias or even have partial to no conclusion at the end. The frequency of “Unknown or Missing” values is large and common across most of the query criterias.\nIndication of ‘0’ values: For our use case, 0 indicates that for a certain group of people or regions or states have not experienced a cancer type, it completely goes against the norm of real world data because common formed pattern indicates that even if small amount, but people or regions or states do experience a type of cancer. This issue will create a lot of bias and instability in terms of visulization as one may even reach a wrong analysis or conclusion."
