    "text": "1.1 Why did we think of this problem statement and in particular “Cancer”?\nFor us, the dataset is not just statistics but the journeys of real individuals, families, and communities and we want visualization to breathe life into these numbers, unveiling patterns and nuances that might otherwise remain hidden to all.\nFor us, it’s personal because every data point represents a person - a mother, a brother, a friend—affected by cancer. Visualization isn’t just about making sense of information, it’s about understanding the human stories behind the data. It’s about identifying trends that could mean the difference between early detection and missed opportunities, between effective interventions and overlooked disparities.\nVisualizations become a bridge between the scientific and the personal. They help us comprehend the impact of cancer on diverse populations, guiding healthcare decisions, policy changes, and individual choices. They empower individuals to take charge of their health by understanding risks and adopting preventive measures.\nSo, in a deeply personal sense, visualizing cancer data is about translating numbers into narratives, empowering individuals with knowledge, and ultimately striving for a world where fewer stories are marked by the challenges posed by cancer."

I just changed this.."
